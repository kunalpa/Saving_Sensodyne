At first I thought it was being caused by some sugar-free licorice discs that I bought at the same time. But I stopped eating those, and was able to narrow down this new, horrible phenomenon to the morning after every time that I used this toothpaste. Layers of my mouth actually peel off, and it hurts! I have experimented with it enough now to know that it is this toothpaste causing this!!! My usual brand, Colgate Sensitive, has never done this to me, but my dentist said the Sensodyne brand worked better, so I switched. Bad decision! No toothpaste has ever done this to me before.

A few days after I used it, I got a terrible sore throat, blister on the edges and under my tongue and small blisters on the inner wall of my mouth. I could not stick my tongue out, it was painful. I thought I had mouth cancer or something. I was terrified.I traced what changed in my daily routine ... it was the toothpaste. I tested out my suspicion by stop using the Sensodyne toothpaste for a week and my sores were all gone.Then I use it again to make sure that it’s not the toothpaste. My mouth sores came back instantly. I did some online research and found that many people have the same problem as me.I am glad that I found the culprit of my mouth sores.

These folks don't care that their product is inconsistent and potentially damaging people's teeth. Burning sensations on your teeth from a product that is suppose to help with sensitivity can't be good. Switched to Colgate Sensitive with Whitening and couldn't be happier.

When I finally took the time to really look, I realized that there were holes in the enamel of three of my bottom teeth. HOLES.I rushed to my dentist who wasn’t surprised. He explained that Sensodyne’s whitening toothpaste actually has to be STRONGER than normal whitening products since the desensitizing agent essentially cancels out the whitening part of the product.I realize my reaction to the toothpaste is probably rare, but anyone who uses this product or other whitening products marketed for sensitive teeth should know that the advertising is deceptive and frankly unsafe.

"United States",,"2021-08-20","false","930","B0762LYF5D","1","8/20/2021 My dentist wanted me to use Sensodyne for a sensitive gum/tooth pain on 7/12/2021. A little over a week of use, the skin and tissue started shedding in my mouth on my gums and putting a film on my teeth. It made many teeth and my tongue become sensitive and painful. It created DRY MOUTH(never  even heard of that), I used a swab to remove the strings of continuous loss of skin and tissue. The area it was to help, got worse. I now have food that sticks to my teeth after eating. That has never happened! I was reading a book and my crown fell out and thankful I didn't swallow it. That's when I knew I had to get to my dentist. I also quit using Sensodyne 5 days before I went to my dentist today . The shedding of tissue and skin has almost stopped, my teeth pain is slowly going away. I bought BIOTENE toothpaste to help my dry mouth. My dentist said that it should reduce and eventually stop my dry mouth. Then he put my crown back on. He said my entire mouth had an allergic reaction to the ingredients.If you notice anything changing in your mouth, stop using Sensodyne immediately! I continued to use it, thinking all this would stop, but it got worse after 2 more weeks. It was very scary and glad I quit brushing with Sensodyne when I did.WARNING... KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR MOUTH IF YOU START USING SENSODYNE. HOPEFULLY THIS WON'T HAPPEN TO YOU.",,,,"2 people found this helpful","SENSODYNE TOOTHPASTE WAS A NIGHTMARE!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMZG3DZWM7R3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0762LYF5D","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2021","Size: 4 Ounce (Pack of 3)"

I cant speak for other variants of sensodyne toothpaste, but this particular listing and product literally made my teeth and gums much more sensitive, as well as made my whole bottom row ache for two days. I was hoping this would finally be the solution for my sensitive teeth. I was wrong. I’m not sure if this product is even real. There was no real seal, the bottle seemed cheap and not like the ones given to me by the dentist. There was a “gsk” logo, which also seemed unauthentic. I brushed my teeth with pro health crest toothpaste, which isn’t even made or marketed to make your teeth less sensitive and increase enamel, but after one brush, I noticed a huge difference. I could feel my teeth become healthier. I have peeling on the inside of my lip from using this toothpaste for about a week and I wouldn’t recommend this buy to anyone...

Lol but I was experiencing very sensitive gums, tooth sensitivity, etc. I thought I was loosing my teeth. I kept buying this specifically bevause it was Sensodyne and my previous dentist recommended it. I couldn't figure out what was happening until I switched dentists. She informed me that MANY MAJOR BRANDS like this actually have corrosive chemicals that achieve the opposite of what they are precisely marketing. It keeps the dental industry booming basically. I switched to a toothpaste with Nano HA, which basically remineralizes your teeth. (Do your research, trust me you'll want to know about this stuff) After only the first TWO days, I noticed a significant difference. No discomfort or pain, and my teeth are now also less transparent after a couple weeks of use. I switched to Ctx4 gel 1100, but that's just one brand that has Nano HA, a ton of others do as well.  please PLEASE if you're struggling with these symptoms, do your research on what you're using!

"United States","🇺🇸","2019-07-14","true","75","B0762LYF5D","5","If your teeth are sensitive (think about pain when you eat ice cream, or bite into a hot burger or fries) and your teeth are otherwise healthy - then this will help you drastically. If you have receding gums, maybe from brushing too hard, or other reasons, then you tooth dentin is exposed and that means anything hot, cold or sweet will hit those tooth nerves and send shooting pains throughout your mouth. This toothpaste fills in the ""holes"" in the dentin where your root is exposed so the food can't go directly to the nerve and send that shooting pain. I used this toothpaste for years and it helped dramatically. At one point I decided to switch to another toothpaste and the pain came back. There are no other toothpastes I have tried that reduce the pain dramatically - almost completely ""cure"" it, with regular daily use, other then this toothpaste.This toothpaste can vary greatly in price and especially different versions of sensodyne might be more expensive. If you have healthy sensitive teeth, I would buy any version of sensodyne that is the cheapest you can find. They are technically all the same ingredients regardless of what ailment it's targeting; they will all help with sensitive teeth.
