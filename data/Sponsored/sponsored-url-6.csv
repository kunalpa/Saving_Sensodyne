This toothpaste also whitens and works to prevent cavities.I use this toothpaste just like any other, and it works fine.  I don’t experience tooth sensitivity often, and my teeth are a normal shade.  The arctic breeze flavor is mild and refreshing, unlike other brands of toothpaste I’ve used with strong flavors.  After using this toothpaste over the past month, I don’t notice any changes.  My tooth enamel probably doesn’t need to be repaired.As a coffee drinker, I am concerned about staining my teeth and making them darker.  I don’t notice any difference with my teeth color, and my dentist recently confirmed my shade was normal.  Whiter teeth would be nice, but I’m more concerned with fighting stains.I don’t normally use Sensodyne toothpaste but have no concerns about doing so.  This toothpaste works as well as my normal whitening brand.  If you have sensitive teeth, perhaps the Sensodyne Pronamel intensive enamel repair whitening toothpaste is right for you.► PROS:Protects teethReduces sensitivityWhitensRefreshing flavor► CONS:None I could find",,,"One person found this helpful","Cool Flavor: A Sensodyne Pronamel Intensive Enamel Repair Whitening Toothpaste Review","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V8V7XVN5WZV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z5WQWM","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2021","Configuration: Toothpaste"

I thought it was just part of getting old or something. At my dentist appointment the other day they told me they were stains and polished those spots right off. I'm still leaving this at 4 stars because it did work amazing for my sensitivity, but it just doesn't have enough abrasive in it to keep stains at bay.-----I have not noticed my teeth getting any whiter, but they are pretty white already (I don't drink coffee or anything) and the flavor is alright. I mean, it's toothpaste.However, when it comes to tooth sensitivity, holy cow, I am a Sensodyne convert. I'm in my mid-30's and started to notice that my teeth were sensitive to ice water, cold grapes, really anything that came out of the fridge. It wasn't painful per se, just really uncomfortable and I winced every time I'd take a sip or I'd gotten used to eating cold food on one side of my mouth that was less sensitive.2 days with Sensodyne and I noticed an immediate difference. I've been using it for a couple of months now (twice a day, I'm nearly through my first tube) and it's gotten even a bit better. I can still tell which teeth aren't thrilled about cold temps, but it's knocked the severity or uncomfortableness down from about a 6 out of 10 to a 2 out of 10.I was impressed there was such a large change in such a short amount of time. I expected a slow change over months, so I was more than excited when just a few days in I could chug ice water when I came in from mowing the lawn in the July heat.
