It was painful to eat or drink anything cold or hot. Also, painful on one side to chew anything crunchy.  I saw my dentist in June 2022, and he recommended Sensodyne toothpaste. It took a couple of weeks to start working, and to my surprise I no longer have the same sensitivity that I was suffering through a few months ago. This toothpaste has helped me tremendously! Also, at the recommendation of other reviews that I’ve read by other people, I started using the Sensodyne mouthwash as well. It’s kind of expensive but well worth it if you’re suffering from tooth and gum sensitivity. My dentist also recommended to apply a little bit of the toothpaste directly on my gums with a Q-tip right before bed. I’m so grateful but I’m no longer suffering. I highly and strongly recommend Sensodyne toothpaste to anyone who suffers from tooth and gum sensitivity.",,,,"9 people found this helpful","Huge relief from tooth sensitivity","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FMRWF1E0LJ8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z57SV9","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 10, 2022",""
