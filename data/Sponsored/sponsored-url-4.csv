"United States","🇺🇸","2023-03-29","true","1","B07YXDVT9W","5","After trying more brands of toothpaste for sensitive teeth than I can count (including the original Sensodyne), I came across the Repair and Protect version last year. And I have happily gone a whole year without painful teeth and with good dental checkups, too! But I noticed that my teeth were showing more tea stains than ever before. I didn't want to give up my Repair and Protect toothpaste but finally decided to check for whitening toothpaste that protected teeth. I was so happy to find that I can get my favorite toothpaste with whitening! I've only been using it for a few days, but I can already see a difference. Note that it has a rougher, more pasty feel in the mouth (probably from the silica) than the non-whitening variety. This was disconcerting the first few times, but now I'm used to it. And I'm very happy with my whiter teeth.",,,"2 people found this helpful","Eliminates sensitivity and whitens teeth!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VBSJXQEQZFX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 29, 2023","Flavor Name: WhiteningSize: 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 2)"

"United States","🇺🇸","2014-10-29","true","78","B07YXDVT9W","5","An update on this product which I have now been using for almost a month.  It is missing Novamin but  has definitely helped with the sensitivity in my one tooth, maybe even more so than the UK version.  It is slightly stickier so if you brush without adding water, the toothpaste clings to the sensitive area more easily and is in my opinion more effective.  I also find it easier to rub a bit of the US version onto the sensitive tooth and it stays there for a while.  Unless you have sever dry mouth, you do not need to add water to toothpaste as it just dilutes it.  This product does not deserve the bad reviews - I wonder whether some reviewers even tried it or just gave it bad reviews because it does not contain Novamin.  I will continue to use it and now have to think twice about buying the UK version next month.  - Older review:  I previously bought mine in the UK, love it for sensitivity but have run out so searched and saw some bad reviews so did some research.  It turns out that the FDA would not approve the use of the most important ingredients Novamin so I will keep buying it in the UK.  I guess that it why some people are not finding it as effective as it should be.  See article below.  I do think Sensodyne works very well so this product will probably help but just a pity it will not work as well as the UK version.  I purchased a tube so see me through until I go to the UK and to compare.  If you have a particularly sensitive spot, apply some toothpaste to the root area, leave it there and do not drink or eat anything for as long as possible.  It will definitely help with more severe sensitivity.http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass",,,"6 people found this helpful","I have used both UK & US Product","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C5R3OOX9QOMN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 29, 2014","Flavor Name: MintSize: 3.4 Ounce"

Specifically my tongue. It felt kind of numb/tingly/burnt. I couldn’t figure out what was causing it. Then I remembered i switched my toothpaste...about three months prior to this one. I stopped using it about a month ago and my tongue is slowly starting to feel a little more normal.Reading other reviews, I did see a couple others complain of something similar, but I’m guessing it’s not common. Just beware that if you start noticing something odd, just stop using it right away.

I couldn't eat anything sweet or cold without being in pain for a good two minutes after each bite.I decided I would switch from Crest over to Sensodyne and see if it actually worked. Holy crap, was I was surprised. Literally within three days, I was eating food that I hadn't been able to eat in weeks. I changed nothing in my diet and nothing in my teeth cleaning regiment besides switching to Sensodyne. Even now I can tell when I've been off of it for a few days. Recently, I went on vacation and forgot toothpaste, so I had to use the Colgate provided by the hotel, and I could tell just in the few days I was off of it, how drastically the sensitivity in my teeth changed for the worse.

This stuff is amazing. If you try anything else but Sensodyne toothpaste, thinking it will take away the pain in your tooth, think again. Don't be fooled. I've tried them all. The only product that works is Sensodyne. Give it a week of using it many times...it's effect is cumulative. Once the product accumulates in the painful places the pain will reduce significantly to absolutely bearable to being gone altogether.Twice I made the HUGE mistakes of trying a different product when on both occassions, all of a sudden after the Sensodne wore off in my teeth a few days to a week later, the pain in my teeth was so unbearable that I was actually seeing sparkly stars. I felt I would need to get all of my teeth pulled out to make the pain go away the last time. It was that awful. I should have learned the first time that nothing but Sensodyne works. But I did not listen to myself. Regretfully, I was curious. I wish I had not been, but I was.I immediately bought more Sensodyne and a new very soft brush and began brushing my teeth several times a day and even rubbing Sensodyne onto my teeth and just letting it be there for a while before rinsing it out. In a few days the pain was relieved enough to not feel panicky about it. By the end of the week the pain was gone and I could eat normally again.I will NEVER jump ship and use another so-called pain relief toothpaste again. The only one that actually works GREAT is Sensodyne.",,,"5 people found this helpful","Teeth pain BEGONE!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SFR47W5CFDQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 27, 2014","Flavor Name: MintSize: 3.4 Ounce"

Personally I've been using sensodyne sensitivity until I got this. Our platinum Dentist facility is very well known for the name and professional services provided. And the sensodyne repair was recommended as it focuses on repair of the damaged tooth and helps with the enamel lose as well. So I'd say to get professional advice on getting the specific type so that you get our problems helped! But regardless, sensodyne company has done their job so well that it is a must get for the tooth paste. (I'd put a picture but it's the tooth, you can't really tell the difference from it).I SAY GET THAT SENSODYNE!!!! It's your mouth a place where you input your food, kiss your loved ones, and do many other things with! And EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE when you have to fix it for US dental coverage. So!

I really don't know why I didn't use it sooner but for years I have been using different toothpastes to try to get my teeth white and shiny and I found a few that did a decent job but my teeth were still pretty yellow.  I tried Arm & Hammer, Crest Whitening, and even fancy European brands that touted themselves as the greatest things ever in whitening toothpastes ( like Marvis and Elgydium ) but NOTHING has whitened my teeth better than Sensodyne and I have only been using it for ONE WHOLE MONTH!  My friend told me about it a few months ago and when I finally pulled the trigger I knew, after using it for THE VERY FIRST TIME, that this was the toothpaste I had been searching for all those years.  For one thing it wasn't abrasive on my teeth like other toothpastes and it didn't irritate them so it doesn't hurt from irriitation when I use it.  Another point is that it leaves you teeth SQUEAKY CLEAN LIKE YOU HAVE JUST COME FROM THE DENTIST and your breath is fresh as an ocean breeze!  The whitening capabilities of this toothpaste are nothing short of amazing and I noticed a difference after THE VERY FIRST WEEK.  Yes, this stuff really works!  One thing I really don't care for about this toothpaste is the taste.  The taste isn't that great, it's minty but not a sweet way more like a medicinal way but it's bearable but it doesn't taste good like other, crappy toothpastes.  This stuff really works so I can forego the taste!  All in all you can't go wrong with Sensodyne toothpaste.  It really is worth the money and who wouldn't pay the miniscule price they ask for it to have a beautiful smile?!",,,"10 people found this helpful","This is the REAL DEAL.

"United States",,"2013-05-26","false","1363","B07YXDVT9W","1","Sensodyne Repair and Protect is one of the only toothpastes to include an unique ingredient called Novamin. Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won't react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth's surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid's compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defences against teeth sensitivity as it seals exposed dentin. Novamin can also help whiten teeth over time.For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe, however with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is like all the others. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definitely not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste like the EU version has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) may cause stains to form. If you just want a stannous fluoride toothpaste it is available in crest pro health and is much cheaper.",,,"287 people found this helpful","GSK drops the ball with the US release of this toothpaste","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U6RLAOAJZRWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2013","Flavor Name: MintSize: 3.4 Ounce"

I recently got my teeth cleaned hypersonically, and using this toothpaste HURT after that especially.The active ingredient which is key behind the ""repair"" aspect of things, Novamin (calcium sodium phosphosilicate) was swapped with stannous flouride in the US released Sensodyne R&P. Not that stannous flouride is a bad thing for toothpaste, but it doesn't actively promote remineralization of teeth like Novamin does. Why GSK chose to rush R&P onto the US market without fighting the FDA bull crap and doing it right, I can only attribute to money grubbing.It is also strange that all of the smaller toothpaste brands on the US market which contained Novamin are disappearing. Dr. Collins, Burt's Bees, and Sultan HC have all been unexplainably discontinued or ""reformulated"". Such a mystery conjures up theatrical images of corporate espionage, but the more likely explanation is that GSK is refusing to supply Novamin to those companies ever since they bought the rights to Novamin.

She uses Sensodyne because it's gentle enough on her teeth but also helps keep them as strong as possible. I also have to admit that my teeth have become stronger since using this stuff.

Thankfully, my sensitive tooth areas have faded and I no longer need this product, because I absolutely cannot and will not use it any longer. For weeks, if not months, my lips have been dry and peeling, and the skin surrounding my lips has been dry, red, and flaking. Thinking this condition was caused by dehydration, I've purchased countless creams and expensive chapsticks to rehydrate my skin and lips. I've started taking a multivitamin to eliminate the possibility of a vitamin deficiency. I've been embarrassed for weeks, trying my best to hide my lips, yet not affect them further with cover-up. As I was thinking about what change could I have possibly instated within the past few months that could have caused this reaction, I remembered I had recently switched from a competitor brand to Sensodyne. So I stopped using Sensodyne Repair & Protect Whitening over a week ago, and my lips have FINALLY returned to normal! I can't believe it! Never again will I use this product. After researching online, I've read claims about an allergy to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate being the common cause. However, my competitor brand toothpaste contains SLS, too, and does not have the same affect on my lips and skin.

While it did provide some whitening effects, I didn't notice a significant difference in the brightness of my teeth after using it for several weeks. Also, the taste and texture of the toothpaste were not my favorite - it had a somewhat gritty texture and a strong taste that lingered in my mouth after brushing.Overall, I would recommend Sensodyne Repair and Protect Whitening Toothpaste for those with sensitive teeth who are looking for a product that offers cavity prevention.

"United States","🇺🇸","2020-03-12","false","1297","B07YXDVT9W","5","We live in a society where hygiene is a key factor in success and having good health. Nowadays there are a multitude of toothpastes and when it comes to the health of your mouth and teeth, choosing the correct toothpaste should never be overlooked. When it came to purchasing toothpaste, I always found myself purchasing products that said, “pure white” or “ultra-white teeth.” I was always focused on making my teeth white and shiny and found myself not caring what was inside the toothpaste or what it was doing to my teeth. Unfortunately, this past year I had developed problems with sensitivity and soreness in my teeth and gums. I decided to consult with my dentist to see why this was occurring. In doing so, my dentist had informed me that I was experiencing decay to my enamel. My dentist had advised me to use Sensodyne toothpaste. With this being said, I was a little iffy about purchasing Sensodyne because I thought I would lose having white shiny teeth. However, I decided to do more research about Sensodyne and see if this product was worth trying.In my research I found that the company Sensodyne uses large appeals of rhetoric in hopes of persuading people like me to purchase their product. They utilize credibility by expressing that “Sensodyne is the #1 dentist recommended brand for sensitive teeth” (Sensodyne). This statement indicates that dentists support the claim that Sensodyne is a healthy sensitive reducing toothpaste. In addition, they incorporate statistical facts, such as labels and ingredients that they use in the product. One main ingredient used in the toothpaste is fluoride, “which helps fight against cavities, so you can maintain healthy teeth every day” (Sensodyne). Furthermore, they use pathos to draw in the consumers; for example, they constantly state: “With twice daily brushing” (Sensodyne), which can be indicated that if you do not brush your teeth daily the product might not be as successful. Therefore, the use of this emotion is to address the audience that you should be brushing your teeth twice a day. Moreover, Sensodyne conveys the message that they are a global company that dedicates science and research to “help people do more, feel better, and live longer” (Wadia).After further examination, I decided to evaluate the comments from other consumer reviews. During this, I found that the main cons to this product was its price and the small tube sizes. It can be seen that the toothpaste ranges from $10.00 to $12.00 and has an average tube size of 3.4 ounces. The negative of this, is that consumers are having to often purchase more toothpaste due to the lack of quantity that the size of the paste provides. Other than that, the toothpaste expresses significant pros to the product. For example, Sensodyne relieves sensitivity, prevents cavities, helps with bad breath, and keeps teeth white and clean.Overall, after doing my research I found that I was successfully persuaded to purchase and try out this product. It has been two months now and my teeth and gums are no longer sore or as sensitive as they were. The product started to relieve the pain after a few days of using the toothpaste and even though it is designed for sensitive teeth, I continue to use it daily. In addition, my mouth feels healthy and very clean. Plus, my teeth are as white or even whiter than the toothpastes that specifically state: “pure” or “ultra-white teeth.” Even though the cons of this product have an effect on one from purchasing this toothpaste, the pros most certainly outweigh the negatives. I feel that other reviews are accurate to the point of how well this product works on teeth. All inclusive, I highly recommend this product to others who are in search of not just curing sensitive teeth, but also are looking for cleaner healthier white teeth!",,,"2 people found this helpful","The Success of Sensodyne Toothpaste -By: Kayla N.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R197YPVAS57E83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 12, 2020","Flavor Name: WhiteningSize: 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 2)"

It's not awful just didn't give me any results. It was late in shipping too.Edit: I was watching t.v. and seen a commercial for this product pop up, and from what I remember it just leaves a thin film on your teeth to protect them from foods and drinks so the enamel doesn't deteriorate anymore than it has. It's also supposed to protect the teeth from pain and sensitivity which it really hasn't for me but I have noticed that with this toothpaste I can feel that my teeth are kind of slippery, it's hard to describe but I can tell there is a layer of something on them after brushing with sensodyne. So...I think this may be a good toothpaste to prevent your teeth from becoming even more damaged and that's about it.

On a previous visit for x-Rays, cleaning and an exam, my dentist advised that he saw a small spot on one of my teeth that he thought could be the start of a cavity.  So we scheduled another appointment for a filling about six weeks later.During that time I switched to Sensodyne Repair and Protect, brushing twice a day and paying special attention to the tooth with the suspected cavity.When I returned to his office for the filling, my dentist examined the tooth again and concluded that the suspected cavity did not require a filling, and said the appointment ""was on him"" and no charge would be billed.  I mentioned that I had been using Sensodyne Repair and Protect exclusively for the past six weeks, and he said that it could have helped mitigate the cavity.That occurred over a year and another two visits for cleanings and checkups ago, and still no recurrence of a potential cavity in the suspect tooth.

I even tried similar, less expensive brands, but nothing has ever worked like Sensodyne, any version.  Therefore, when I had a coupon and combined it with a sale to get R&P, I figured it would work even better than the ones I had been using.  WRONG!  From the very 1st time I used it my teeth hurt, and every subsequent brushing was equally painful.  I looked at the ingredients and discovered that the amount of  fluoride is equal to the amount in the prescribed tube of fluoride I use every night.  So I put my Rx'd tube aside, thinking maybe I was applying too much fluoride.  It didn't help.  Finally, I noticed sensitivity while eating something cold that I had not experienced since years ago, before starting to use Sensodyne. That's when I decided: enough!  I threw my 1/2 used tube of R&P away (and I NEVER throw anything away!) and went back to using the  regular Sensodyne.  No pain, and immediate relief upon eating hot & cold.
