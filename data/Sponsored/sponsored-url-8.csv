What really caught my attention was when my mouth, lips, tongue, and throat broke out in literally dozens of canker sores. Nothing else had changed about my diet, stress level, or personal habits. Were it not for the wonders of the internet, I might never have figured out that this product was the problem. The pain is incredible, and if this helps anyone else who is getting over the horror caused by the misnamed Rapid Relief, using buttermilk or kefir as a mouthwash was the only thing that kept me from screaming 24/7 while I waited for the sores to go away.

That's how bad this toothpaste is... 3.5 years later and it still haunts me!!I received this product as a sample through BzzAgent. Sensodyne sent it for me to try in exchange for my honest opinion. #GotItFree #ButYouCantPayMeToUseItAgainI started using this toothpaste shortly after receiving it and brushed with it twice a day. Right off, I noticed how it seemed to repel water. (Drop a small amount into an already wet sink and watch that water scatter.. cool!) After brushing with it, my mouth felt clean but it almost felt TOO clean. It is hard to explain but it seemed like the toothpaste was drying out my mouth or killing off the bad AND good bacteria -- it seemed as if there was hydrogen peroxide or something in it?? I continued to use the toothpaste and after about the 4th day, I noticed how incredibly dry my lips were. I also was beginning to get a canker sore on the inside of my cheek as well as the corners of my mouth were cracking and hurting. I decided that was enough of the new toothpaste! I have stopped using the Rapid Relief toothpaste and returned to my old Sensodyne Pronamel 2 days ago. Unfortunately, my mouth has not improved and is still getting worse. I literally have not been able to eat much at all except ice cream and nothing helps for the pain. I don't know how long this will take to improve but I already know it won't be fast enough! I've had issues previously with the Sensodyne Pronamel Fresh Breath toothpaste causing canker sores previously; however, never as extreme as this Rapid Relief caused. Interestingly, I don't seem to react a bit to the Sensodyne Pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste. I plan on comparing the ingredient list but for now I think my best bet is to take a nap to try to forget the pain. It is really that awful. **Disclaimer** I do have terribly sensitive skin and react to a LOT of things that most people don't. For example, I react to all metals aside from rhodium and platinum. (Even 925 sterling silver and stainless steel cause contact dermatitis for me!)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614Y8I7asTL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712-oe30LlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ri5T2q2tL._SY88.jpg","One person found this helpful","Major allergy warning!

I started using this toothpaste at the recommendation of my dentist. After about two weeks of usage, my gums started becoming tender. I am pregnant, so I chalked it up to hormonal changes and actually started using more of the toothpaste. Then my salivary glands started swelling under my tongue and I started seeing white patchy stuff under my tongue and on the side of my gums (I now know this was the skin in my mouth peeling like a sunburn). I went to my Primary Care Physician who thought it might be a bacterial infection and gave me antibiotics, which did not help. I went to my dentist, who sadly enough, did not put together that I had just changed toothpastes and was baffled by what he saw. By then, my whole mouth had severe red and white sores causing severe pain. I could barely eat or talk. He referred me to an oral surgeon. While waiting to go to the oral surgeon, I was in so much pain, I almost went to the Emergency Room, just to find some relief. Then, it finally dawned on me, ""I wonder if my toothpaste is doing this?""  I did an internet search and low and behold there are multiple incidents of people having the exact same problem. If I hadn't seen that, I would not have known for sure that this toothpaste was the culprit. So I stopped using it and my mouth sores cleared up in 4 days!! This product is dangerous.

If you have constant mouth-sores, sensitive gums, bleeding gums and always a weird taste on your tongue and you are using this particular sensodyne, look no further, you are not sick with some horrendous disease, its this toothpaste. Apparently, (dont quote me on it, im not a doctor) Some toothpastes contain an ingredient called Sls which is very strong and can cause these outbreaks. Since i started using this toothpaste, i had constant mouthsores and bleeding gums out of the blue, of course i checked myself out, did everything, stopped coffee, nothing happened then i just randomly started thinking of causes, and googled if toothpaste can cause mouth sores and lo and behold i found this information. I switched toothpastes, went to an organic natural Sls free toothpaste and BINGO! No sores, no bleeding sore gums, fresh feeling, I feel amazing again after months of constant mouthsores. It may work for some and maybe some do not get this side effect but this is my story. The other brands like Sensodyne pro enamal are sls free and do not cause this.

Once I realized it was the toothpaste, I quit using immediately. But even after a week of not using, my mouth is still a mess. I'm using an antiseptic mouthwash with hydrogen peroxide to help heal. I plan to contact their customer service as they need better warming labels on this toothpaste.",,,,"One person found this helpful","Needs a warning label","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TXP3ZPMLD2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B079Y7RCZ6","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 24, 2020",""
