My mom had given me a couple travel size Sensodyne products from her dentist and I liked them but maybe there was something else out there I'd also like.I tried a Tom's of Maine charcoal whitening before realizing that was owned by Colgate too. I was paying a company that was capable of making a toothpaste that didn't hurt to use, but at a slightly premium price compared to their other brands/products. That felt scummy, so I went to Burt's Bees charcoal whitening variety. I was half way through my second tube and liked it for the flavor and price but I developed a sensitivity. It was basically causing a chemical type burn or irritation on and around my lips. It quickly got pretty bad. Inflamed, peeling, pain. Thanks sensitive skin!I gave the rest of my Burt's tube to a friend and bought Sensodyne's charcoal variety. It looks like a horror movie when brushing your teeth. That stuff is jet black and doesn't foam up white or even grey. Unfortunately it doesn't even taste that great either. I've read conflicting reports about the abrasiveness of charcoal in toothpaste on teeth so I was ready to switch again.This 4 pack went on sale during prime day, making it cheaper than at Costco per oz, so I was thrilled to buy and try. I've actually been enjoying brushing instead of it being a chore. No funky grey or black color in my mouth from charcoal. No chemical aftertaste. So far so good and I guess I should have just stuck with Sensodyne this whole time because it works.",,,,"17 people found this helpful","Fresh and Clean","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MA1HD58RPGE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z6SVNB","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2022",""

Ask your dentist or dental hygienist and they'll tell you that a whitening agent weakens enamel. If you want to strengthen your enamel, why buy toothpaste with a whitening agent which does the opposite? Seems counter-intuitive. It says on the box that Sensodyne Pronamel is for Specialist Enamel Protection. It's advertised to rebuild & restore enamel and protect against the effects of dietary acid. Sounds good to me. But now there's a new version out called Intensive Enamel REPAIR. It has the exact same list & percentage of active ingredients, comes in a smaller tube (3.4 oz. vs 4.0 oz), costs about the same, and is advertised to repair weakened enamel and to drive minerals deep into the enamel surface to help actively repair acid-weakened areas. Can anyone tell me the difference between the two versions besides size & flavor? I suspect the consumer is getting 15% less product for about the same cost, a brilliant marketing strategy.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tELJy3ywL._SY88.jpg",,,"24 people found this helpful","Great product but read the label","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BJ8OXL23UX1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z6SVNB","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 8, 2022",""

I don't really have a bad breath problem but four tubes for 21 bucks is a great deal compared to my local store.  I started using this and before writing a review I wanted to wait a couple of weeks to see if my usual sensitivity came back (two weeks on Crest Detox toothpaste was all it took to bring back my sensitivity) and so far it has not, so that's good.  I can tell that this is a different flavor from other Sensodyne I have used in the past, it is not overly strong and it does not bother me, it is just different.  It is too minty for one of my daughters to use, and another daughter who likes mint a lot and who is very self conscious right now likes using this for the breath freshening, not that she has a problem with bad breath either, she just over thinks things.
