It's probably the closest that Sensodyne makes now to what used to be their Mint Essence product but it just doesn't taste as good and is not quite the same mouthfeel. But it's close. I don't like any other toothpastes that I've tried so I'll stick with it. The price for this combo is good compared to local store pricing. Can't say that it whitens your teeth anymore than any other product out there but I buy Sensodyne for the teeth sensitivity aspect and the better taste and feel than other brands.

The effects are not immediate and it's not like a magic moment, but I've been using it for several months now and I can definitely say that my teeth feel healthier and stronger.

Second, it has a mild flavor and leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth. Other toothpastes, including other versions of Pronamel, can be so strong that the cool, minty/fresh flavor is so overwhelming that you can't drink or eat anything a half-hour or even an hour or more later without tasting nothing but toothpaste.But does it do anything for your enamel? Well, I'm no expert. What I am is addicted to soda, which is why I started using this. About 8 years into my usage of this toothpaste, I started going to a new dentist. He actually marveled at how great my enamel looked. I, of course, didn't tell him about my soda habit.In terms of guarding against sensitivity, this toothpaste is fairly helpful. I do have a couple of trouble spots, however, that this toothpaste does not help.I wouldn't use this toothpaste as an excuse to be harsh on your teeth, but I'm quite pleased with it!

My teeth are sensitive and I have lost enamel from consuming lots of citrics when I was younger.

It's terrible because after it splits it gets really messy if you try to get the remainder product out.At first I thought maybe I was being too rough with it when putting the cap back on and twisting (tubes are made of a soft/thin plastic)... I'm not a rough person in general, but gave this product the benefit of the doubt.With the second pack I was very gentle with screwing the cap, being careful not to twist too hard.
