After sharing half of it with my friend and trying it for a year, I bought another 4 pack when I ran out. The newest 4 pack I just bought has an expiry date of 9/2023, so I have about a year and a half to use them up. Each tube is sealed with foil until you’re ready yo use it.I’ve been using sensodyn for over a decade now because my dentist had recommended it. Over the years, I’ve tried many different varieties and flavors. This tooth paste works well in keeping my teeth pain free for the most part, as long as I don’t overdo it with eating a ton of acidic foods. So daily bowl of fruit or occasional glass of white wine no longer cause tooth aches.The one big difference between this and the other sensodyn varieties I’ve tried in the past is the foam texture. It’s not super foaming like some gel toothpastes, and actually almost coagulates into little wisps of more solid texture as you brush, which I thought was weird and took a little time to get used to. However, this cleans pretty well combined with my electric toothbrush and I’ve been very happy with it overall, as evidenced by my repurchase.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515RL2ufFOL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tb5hTI96L._SY88.jpg",,,"14 people found this helpful","Toothpaste for sensitive teeth","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21BIUB65IUGRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z5PKDJ","Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2022",""

I'm not sure if this is a cumulative affect over time, or whether it is some ingredient in the toothpaste that works while brushing only.  It does what it says it does.I've been using Sensodyne toothpastes for a while now.  One thing that I did notice about it is this toothpaste is thicker than other Sensodyne toothpastes.  There is definitely a noticeable difference.  This isn't a complaint and, in fact, makes it a bit easier to use.  Sensodyne toothpastes can normally be a bit thin and can run out of my mouth toward the end of my brushing.  This is a lot less likely to do that.The flavor is not bad.  It's minty, but a little less minty than their other toothpaste types.  It's toothpaste, so it's not like it's going to have an amazing flavor.  It's fine.The one thing that would be great is if Sensodyne would add some whitening ingredients to this.  If they did that, it would be perfect!In terms of cost, I did a quick check of some of the big box stores and Amazon has this priced very reasonably.  Especially with the current $3 off coupon.
