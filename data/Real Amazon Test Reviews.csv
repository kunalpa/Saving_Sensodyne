Review,Label
"This is a great toothpaste when purchased in store. The order I received from Amazon the toothpaste tubes were defective.
Only a quarter through two toothpaste tubes and the seam burst right open.
I love when billion-dollar enterprises will sell you defective product that they probably purchased for pennies to turn around and sell it high cost. Seems fraudulent.
Amazon shame on you for selling defective toothpaste tubes. You are stealing our money.",1
"Product is fake. The paste is looser than usual and doesn’t whiten. I’ve been using Pronamel for years, and decided to buy off Amazon this time and I tell you this is not the Pronamel I’ve been using. The loose paste was a dead giveaway and it most certainly didn’t whiten my teeth at all. I’m going back to buying in store.",1
"The dentist instructed me to use a sensitive toothpaste and not to rinse it off, but I just can't do that with this brand. The film leaves a really bad aftertaste in my mouth. I would often have to get out of bed at night and rinse with mouthwash. Not buying this brand again.",0
"Overall, I don’t care for this brand. I expected better results in cleaning, taste, and whitening.",0
I have been using Sensodyne for years but never bought it on Amazon before. This seem to be different than what you get in store. The quality is not the same. Do not buy.,1
"Not whitening no teeth at all,you guys can do better by adding mint flavor to it for freshness.",0
We've been through two tubes of this and both of them the cap ends up full of toothpaste. The second bottle I tried to get the cap on so carefully (something I really don't have time to do in the morning) and it still ended up gooey and full of toothpaste.,0
Very runny. Not the real stuff. I’m on the second tube of 3 and it’s not thick enough and I just had my teeth cleaned (I get them cleaned every 6 months) and gum sensitivity was way higher. Do not recommend at all,1
"I don’t like this favor, the price is a little bit expensive. I don’t recommend buy this again",0
"don't like the flavor, does work for sensitivity, after taste lingers, and mouth feels 'dirty' sooner than with the Colgate I have used for the past few years",0
"Is this a fake? I got my second order today. The toothpaste foamy expire until the end of 2023 however, it is streaks of beige and white. It felt so weird. And kinda chunky. There is as also no fresh taste to it. Not like the other one we received.",1
"I had my teeth cleaned and had some fillings done recently. My teeth became sensitive to cold and hot food and liquid. I tried this out but it made my teeth even more sensitive. I could feel the dull pain even when I was breathing. Luckily once I stopped using it I didn't feel constant pain, just pain when I eat or drink hot and cold things. I'm hoping that will improve naturally. I know people swear by this toothpaste, but it didn't work for me.",0
"The product flavor is not Alpine Breeze as described.",0
This is more of a reminder to myself to not purchase this toothpaste again. I would have returned it but the window closed early. This toothpaste has no mint flavor of any kind and leaves your entire mouth feeling unclean. I even tried using more than the recommended amount. So never again will I purchase this product.,0
"Fake product",1
"After cleaning my teeth they felt not cleaned at all. And awful taste. Don't buy it. It is not worth it",0
Not only tastes awful it didn’t clean my teeth well at all. Two thumbs down,0
"Noticed no difference in whiteness",0
I had been using this for around 6 months. When I went to the dentist I had a lot of tarter build up. Which I have never had. I switched back to Crest Pro Health and I can feel the difference all ready.,0
"Buyer beware. This product does not do the same as a store bought sensodyne toothpaste. And they also do not let you return.",1
"Specifically says you will receive 3 4 oz tooth pastes but I only received one.",0
I ordered this by mistake... I usually get the non -Pro Enamel. The taste of this toothpaste literally made me gag. It is horrible. I have to throw these tubes away - really horrible taste. EWWWWW,0
"I have sensitive teeth, but I didn't notice any changes at all after several months of use. I keep experiencing the same issues with cold drinks.",0
"Is this the real stuff or did Sensodyne change the ingredients? My lips reacted severely like it has before when using products I’m allergic to. I’ve been using Sensodyne for years, including orders from Amazon???!!!",1
"I heard this was good, and someone I trust said that, so I used this for several months.
Nothing is different. Can't eat anything too cold.",0
"The paste is not consistent and it does not soap in the mouth.",0
The toothpaste causes less foam in mouth that goes dry requiring to add more toothpaste for toothbrush.There is no mint at all and its effectiveness is zero. I don’t like it.,0
his is not the same stuff is at the store. This causes my teeth to be EXTREMELY SENSITIVE after using for only a week. This should be taken off of Amazon. This product is a total scam,1
"This is not official Pronamel toothpaste",1
"This toothpaste was not authentic. I buy it all the time at the pharmacy and the quality was not the same.",1
Bad,0
"Toothpaste left a bitter, unpleasant taste in the mouth. Won't use again.",0
"This is a fake product. I use this toothpaste all the time. The consistency was not the same. It was very watery and very thin.",1
"We received only one tube of toothpaste, not the three expected.",0
"Barely cleans the teeth good.
Not worth it.",0
"I feel like this made my teeth more sensitive!",0
"This is awful & does not work",0
Fake don't buy,1
"Do not like this at all. Crest sensitive toothpaste is much better.",0
"I bought a two pack of this stuff. Never again! It was horrible. It made my teeth look stained, gray and dingy. After using both tubes I went back to my normal Arm & Hammer. What a huge, wonderful difference! And like many people here have stated, the cap is a pain getting off and on.",0
"Counterfeit . I always purchase this from the big box stores and this ""sensodyne"" sold on Amazon might not actually be toothpaste. My best guess is it's a vix vapor rub type product since it smells exactly like it. Buyer beware.",1
"It didn't seem the normal pronamel I'm used to. I would not buy from Amazon.",1
"In my experience, this toothpaste caused 'dry mouth' which was insufferable.",0
"Probably the worst toothpaste I have ever used.",0
"This tastes weird. It’s doesn’t appears to be the same product sold in stores. It didn’t feel like it helped with my teeth sensitive. I wouldn’t recommend whitening for sensitive teeth",1
"This product put sores on my tongue. Very painful. Didn't figure it out until I read on line others were having the same problem. One day with another toothpaste and my tongue is finally getting better.",0
"The package is dirty and damaged. Smells like one of tubes is leaking.",0
Did nothing for my teeth sensitivity. Dissapointed.,0
"This is awful & does not work",0
"I don't like this product: it makes me vomit.",0
