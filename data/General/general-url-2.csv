The product dispenses easily - actually a little too easily - a soft touch gives you the most control on how much goes on your brush.DIRECTIONS: The directions indicate that the user should put an INCH of paste on their brush 😮😣 which goes against the ADA's recommendation of a pea sized amount is all you need. If you don't eat peas, you know how big a plain M&M is? That's how much toothpaste you need. Too much fluoride is bad for you. I have to dock a star for those bad instructions. It's like shampoo that tells you to wash your hair twice.FLAVOR: Nice, minty flavor that's not too strong.MOUTH FEEL: A little goes a long way. This stuff foams up in your mouth and coats all your teeth. If you use a sonic toothbrush it will foam up even more.EFFECTIVENESS: When I'm done brushing, my teeth feel clean and my dentist recommends this for sensitive gums. Since I've been using this, my gums are less sensitive but that happens slowly over time not after just one brushing.",,,,"","Helps with sensitive gums, leaves teeth clean.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11YADBXOH0IJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z57SV9","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 12, 2021",""

This toothpaste is pretty on par with the ones that I have tried. What I like about this one is how Sensodyne always have tubes that feel more premium and it isn't overpowering of taste in mouth.Quality:This product is a little minty but not overpowering. It is enough for you to feel that your teeth is cleaned. I also noticed that spots of sensitivity in my mouth are slightly gone because of this toothpaste after using it for a week. I have not really noticed anything different with the whitening though.Overall, it's an okay product.",,,,"","Pretty Decent Toothpaste","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9EK1U8BNJ2OV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z57SV9","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 4, 2021",""

I was pretty skeptical about this toothpaste but am so happy I found and even happier it is a multi pack because I dont think I can live without it. It truly stops the cold from piercing the top of my teeth near my gums - I would use it just for that BUT it actually helps whiten my teeth too - I would say after a week it was pretty noticeable. It is lighter than a regular paste and some days I brush first with aquafresh then this but all around it is great! Tastes good too!",,,,"","Teeth grinder’s best friend","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A60Z5EV06ANF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z57SV9","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 22, 2021",""

This is the repair and protect and so far it seems to be doing a great job. My spouse has sensitive teeth and swears by this. It tastes pretty good and it's not gritty or anything like that.

"United States","🇺🇸","2021-08-30","false","80","B095Z57SV9","5","I've been using Sensodyne whitening toothpaste for a couple of weeks and it seems to provide clean-feeling teeth comparable to both Crest and Colgate pastes.  While I don't notice a huge difference in feeling while I'm brushing, my teeth and gums don't throb when I rinse with cold water so there must be some nerve-dulling agent that helps.  The paste is a cream-colored variety with very light grit so it's similar other pastes, possibly less gritty.  The taste is pleasant enough if you like peppermint.  I find it's as good if not better than other brands and leaves my mouth feeling pretty fresh when I spit it out after brushing.I haven't noticed increased whitening of my teeth but I assume any difference would take many brushings and I haven't been using enough to comment.  If I do notice a brightening smile I will edit this review to make note of the change.  Overall, Sensodyne appears to work as well as other brands I've tried including Crest, Colgate, and Aqua-Fresh.",,,,"","My teeth feel clean.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HRC6IMTIFF2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095Z57SV9","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 30, 2021",""
