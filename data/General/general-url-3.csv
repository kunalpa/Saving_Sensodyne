And I have happily gone a whole year without painful teeth and with good dental checkups, too! But I noticed that my teeth were showing more tea stains than ever before. I didn't want to give up my Repair and Protect toothpaste but finally decided to check for whitening toothpaste that protected teeth. I was so happy to find that I can get my favorite toothpaste with whitening! I've only been using it for a few days, but I can already see a difference. Note that it has a rougher, more pasty feel in the mouth (probably from the silica) than the non-whitening variety. This was disconcerting the first few times, but now I'm used to it. And I'm very happy with my whiter teeth.",,"2 people found this helpful","Eliminates sensitivity and whitens teeth!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VBSJXQEQZFX8?ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2023","Flavor Name: WhiteningSize: 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 2)"

"United States","🇺🇸","2014-10-29","true","78","B07YXDVT9W","5","An update on this product which I have now been using for almost a month.  It is missing Novamin but  has definitely helped with the sensitivity in my one tooth, maybe even more so than the UK version.  It is slightly stickier so if you brush without adding water, the toothpaste clings to the sensitive area more easily and is in my opinion more effective.  I also find it easier to rub a bit of the US version onto the sensitive tooth and it stays there for a while.  Unless you have sever dry mouth, you do not need to add water to toothpaste as it just dilutes it.  This product does not deserve the bad reviews - I wonder whether some reviewers even tried it or just gave it bad reviews because it does not contain Novamin.  I will continue to use it and now have to think twice about buying the UK version next month.  - Older review:  I previously bought mine in the UK, love it for sensitivity but have run out so searched and saw some bad reviews so did some research.  It turns out that the FDA would not approve the use of the most important ingredients Novamin so I will keep buying it in the UK.  I guess that it why some people are not finding it as effective as it should be.  See article below.  I do think Sensodyne works very well so this product will probably help but just a pity it will not work as well as the UK version.  I purchased a tube so see me through until I go to the UK and to compare.  If you have a particularly sensitive spot, apply some toothpaste to the root area, leave it there and do not drink or eat anything for as long as possible.  It will definitely help with more severe sensitivity.http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass",,"6 people found this helpful","I have used both UK & US Product","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C5R3OOX9QOMN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 29, 2014","Flavor Name: MintSize: 3.4 Ounce"

On a previous visit for x-Rays, cleaning and an exam, my dentist advised that he saw a small spot on one of my teeth that he thought could be the start of a cavity.  So we scheduled another appointment for a filling about six weeks later.During that time I switched to Sensodyne Repair and Protect, brushing twice a day and paying special attention to the tooth with the suspected cavity.When I returned to his office for the filling, my dentist examined the tooth again and concluded that the suspected cavity did not require a filling, and said the appointment ""was on him"" and no charge would be billed.  I mentioned that I had been using Sensodyne Repair and Protect exclusively for the past six weeks, and he said that it could have helped mitigate the cavity.That occurred over a year and another two visits for cleanings and checkups ago, and still no recurrence of a potential cavity in the suspect tooth.  Since that time I have continued using Sensodyne, and so far so good.So based on my experience with this product, I highly recommend it.",,"3 people found this helpful","Look Mom, No Cavities!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NUFRXQOLK8CJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YXDVT9W","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 26, 2015","Flavor Name: WhiteningSize: 3.4 Ounce"

I even tried similar, less expensive brands, but nothing has ever worked like Sensodyne, any version.  Therefore, when I had a coupon and combined it with a sale to get R&P, I figured it would work even better than the ones I had been using.  WRONG!  From the very 1st time I used it my teeth hurt, and every subsequent brushing was equally painful.  I looked at the ingredients and discovered that the amount of  fluoride is equal to the amount in the prescribed tube of fluoride I use every night.  So I put my Rx'd tube aside, thinking maybe I was applying too much fluoride.  It didn't help.  Finally, I noticed sensitivity while eating something cold that I had not experienced since years ago, before starting to use Sensodyne. That's when I decided: enough!  I threw my 1/2 used tube of R&P away (and I NEVER throw anything away!) and went back to using the  regular Sensodyne.  No pain, and immediate relief upon eating hot & cold.
