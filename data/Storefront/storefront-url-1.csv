"United States",,"2022-04-22","true","7","B095Z5PKDJ","5","I originally got a four pack of these in 2021 for free. After sharing half of it with my friend and trying it for a year, I bought another 4 pack when I ran out. The newest 4 pack I just bought has an expiry date of 9/2023, so I have about a year and a half to use them up. Each tube is sealed with foil until you’re ready yo use it.I’ve been using sensodyn for over a decade now because my dentist had recommended it. Over the years, I’ve tried many different varieties and flavors. This tooth paste works well in keeping my teeth pain free for the most part, as long as I don’t overdo it with eating a ton of acidic foods. So daily bowl of fruit or occasional glass of white wine no longer cause tooth aches.The one big difference between this and the other sensodyn varieties I’ve tried in the past is the foam texture. It’s not super foaming like some gel toothpastes, and actually almost coagulates into little wisps of more solid texture as you brush, which I thought was weird and took a little time to get used to. However, this cleans pretty well combined with my electric toothbrush and I’ve been very happy with it overall, as evidenced by my repurchase.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515RL2ufFOL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tb5hTI96L._SY88.jpg","14 people found this helpful","Toothpaste for sensitive teeth","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21BIUB65IUGRS?ASIN=B095Z5PKDJ","Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2022",""

No matter how well I take care of my teeth and gums (and I’m an oral hygiene fanatic), my gums would bleed whenever I brushed and flossed. I’ve tried several recommended gum toothpastes but none worked. I’ve always liked Sensodyne so when I saw they had a gum sensitivity option I figured I’d give it a go. Stopped my persistent gum bleeding within a week.
