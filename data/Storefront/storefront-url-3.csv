I told them I have been getting really sensitive to really hot foods like soups and even simple stuff like eating oranges or grapefruits. Even when I use Crest or Colgate, their mint flavor causes my teeth to burn. So, when I tried out Sensodyne's Deep Clean toothpaste, it was surprisingly wasn't abrasive at all. The mint flavor is subtle, yet my mouth feels clean. I don't taste any sugar aftertaste which is wonderful. My teeth feels squeaky clean, but the added blue coloring is kind of difficult to remove, but I just wash it out with some alcohol free mouthwash.A couple of my friends wanted to try some, so I bought them the trial/travel size for their travel trip to Los Angeles. They agreed that it cleans while doesn't have that burning minty sensation.I've recently discovered Proenamel by Sensodyne, so I am excited to try more of their products prior to my free sample from Sensodyne and BzzAgent. My review is 100% honest and to the best of my knowledge.
