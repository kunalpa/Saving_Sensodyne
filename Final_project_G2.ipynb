Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won't react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth's surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid's compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defences against teeth sensitivity as it seals exposed dentin. Novamin can also help whiten teeth over time.For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe, however with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is like all the others. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definitely not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste like the EU version has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) may cause stains to form.

Why GSK chose to rush R&P onto the US market without fighting the FDA bull crap and doing it right, I can only attribute to money grubbing.It is also strange that all of the smaller toothpaste brands on the US market which contained Novamin are disappearing.

Sensodyne sent it for me to try in exchange for my honest opinion. #GotItFree #ButYouCantPayMeToUseItAgainI started using this toothpaste shortly after receiving it and brushed with it twice a day. Right off, I noticed how it seemed to repel water. (Drop a small amount into an already wet sink and watch that water scatter.. cool!) After brushing with it, my mouth felt clean but it almost felt TOO clean. It is hard to explain but it seemed like the toothpaste was drying out my mouth or killing off the bad AND good bacteria -- it seemed as if there was hydrogen peroxide or something in it?? I continued to use the toothpaste and after about the 4th day, I noticed how incredibly dry my lips were. I also was beginning to get a canker sore on the inside of my cheek as well as the corners of my mouth were cracking and hurting. I decided that was enough of the new toothpaste! I have stopped using the Rapid Relief toothpaste and returned to my old Sensodyne Pronamel 2 days ago. Unfortunately, my mouth has not improved and is still getting worse. I literally have not been able to eat much at all except ice cream and nothing helps for the pain. I don't know how long this will take to improve but I already know it won't be fast enough! I've had issues previously with the Sensodyne Pronamel Fresh Breath toothpaste causing canker sores previously; however, never as extreme as this Rapid Relief caused. Interestingly, I don't seem to react a bit to the Sensodyne Pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste. I plan on comparing the ingredient list but for now I think my best bet is to take a nap to try to forget the pain. It is really that awful. **Disclaimer** I do have terribly sensitive skin and react to a LOT of things that most people don't. For example, I react to all metals aside from rhodium and platinum.

However, it depends on which sensodyne you use. If you have constant mouth-sores, sensitive gums, bleeding gums and always a weird taste on your tongue and you are using this particular sensodyne, look no further, you are not sick with some horrendous disease, its this toothpaste. Apparently, (dont quote me on it, im not a doctor) Some toothpastes contain an ingredient called Sls which is very strong and can cause these outbreaks. Since i started using this toothpaste, i had constant mouthsores and bleeding gums out of the blue, of course i checked myself out, did everything, stopped coffee, nothing happened then i just randomly started thinking of causes, and googled if toothpaste can cause mouth sores and lo and behold i found this information. I switched toothpastes, went to an organic natural Sls free toothpaste and BINGO! No sores, no bleeding sore gums, fresh feeling, I feel amazing again after months of constant mouthsores. It may work for some and maybe some do not get this side effect but this is my story. The other brands like Sensodyne pro enamal are sls free and do not cause this.

Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won't react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth's surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid's compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defences against teeth sensitivity as it seals exposed dentin. Novamin can also help whiten teeth over time.For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe, however with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is like all the others. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definitely not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste like the EU version has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) may cause stains to form.

Not that stannous flouride is a bad thing for toothpaste, but it doesn't actively promote remineralization of teeth like Novamin does. Why GSK chose to rush R&P onto the US market without fighting the FDA bull crap and doing it right, I can only attribute to money grubbing.It is also strange that all of the smaller toothpaste brands on the US market which contained Novamin are disappearing.

Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won't react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth's surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid's compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defences against teeth sensitivity as it seals exposed dentin. Novamin can also help whiten teeth over time.For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe, however with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is like all the others. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definitely not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste like the EU version has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) may cause stains to form.

Not that stannous flouride is a bad thing for toothpaste, but it doesn't actively promote remineralization of teeth like Novamin does. Why GSK chose to rush R&P onto the US market without fighting the FDA bull crap and doing it right, I can only attribute to money grubbing.It is also strange that all of the smaller toothpaste brands on the US market which contained Novamin are disappearing.

I tested out by stop using the Sensodyne toothpaste for a week and my sores were all gone. Then I use it again to make sure that it\\u2019s not the toothpaste. My mouth sores came back instantly. I did some online research and found that many people have the same problem as me.

I noticed it's no longer on here though so I thought I'd share again.  That's how bad this toothpaste is... 3.5 years later and it still haunts me!!I received this product as a sample through BzzAgent. Sensodyne sent it for me to try in exchange for my honest opinion. #GotItFree #ButYouCantPayMeToUseItAgainI started using this toothpaste shortly after receiving it and brushed with it twice a day. Right off, I noticed how it seemed to repel water. (Drop a small amount into an already wet sink and watch that water scatter.. cool!) After brushing with it, my mouth felt clean but it almost felt TOO clean. It is hard to explain but it seemed like the toothpaste was drying out my mouth or killing off the bad AND good bacteria -- it seemed as if there was hydrogen peroxide or something in it?? I continued to use the toothpaste and after about the 4th day, I noticed how incredibly dry my lips were. I also was beginning to get a canker sore on the inside of my cheek as well as the corners of my mouth were cracking and hurting. I decided that was enough of the new toothpaste! I have stopped using the Rapid Relief toothpaste and returned to my old Sensodyne Pronamel 2 days ago. Unfortunately, my mouth has not improved and is still getting worse. I literally have not been able to eat much at all except ice cream and nothing helps for the pain. I don't know how long this will take to improve but I already know it won't be fast enough! I've had issues previously with the Sensodyne Pronamel Fresh Breath toothpaste causing canker sores previously; however, never as extreme as this Rapid Relief caused. Interestingly, I don't seem to react a bit to the Sensodyne Pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste. I plan on comparing the ingredient list but for now I think my best bet is to take a nap to try to forget the pain. It is really that awful. **Disclaimer** I do have terribly sensitive skin and react to a LOT of things that most people don't. For example, I react to all metals aside from rhodium and platinum.

I am pregnant, so I chalked it up to hormonal changes and actually started using more of the toothpaste. Then my salivary glands started swelling under my tongue and I started seeing white patchy stuff under my tongue and on the side of my gums (I now know this was the skin in my mouth peeling like a sunburn). I went to my Primary Care Physician who thought it might be a bacterial infection and gave me antibiotics, which did not help. I went to my dentist, who sadly enough, did not put together that I had just changed toothpastes and was baffled by what he saw. By then, my whole mouth had severe red and white sores causing severe pain. I could barely eat or talk. He referred me to an oral surgeon. While waiting to go to the oral surgeon, I was in so much pain, I almost went to the Emergency Room, just to find some relief. Then, it finally dawned on me, \\\"I wonder if my toothpaste is doing this?\\\"  I did an internet search and low and behold there are multiple incidents of people having the exact same problem.

Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won't react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth's surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid's compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit.

Sensodyne sent it for me to try in exchange for my honest opinion. #GotItFree #ButYouCantPayMeToUseItAgainI started using this toothpaste shortly after receiving it and brushed with it twice a day. Right off, I noticed how it seemed to repel water. (Drop a small amount into an already wet sink and watch that water scatter.. cool!) After brushing with it, my mouth felt clean but it almost felt TOO clean. It is hard to explain but it seemed like the toothpaste was drying out my mouth or killing off the bad AND good bacteria -- it seemed as if there was hydrogen peroxide or something in it?? I continued to use the toothpaste and after about the 4th day, I noticed how incredibly dry my lips were. I also was beginning to get a canker sore on the inside of my cheek as well as the corners of my mouth were cracking and hurting. I decided that was enough of the new toothpaste! I have stopped using the Rapid Relief toothpaste and returned to my old Sensodyne Pronamel 2 days ago. Unfortunately, my mouth has not improved and is still getting worse. I literally have not been able to eat much at all except ice cream and nothing helps for the pain. I don't know how long this will take to improve but I already know it won't be fast enough! I've had issues previously with the Sensodyne Pronamel Fresh Breath toothpaste causing canker sores previously; however, never as extreme as this Rapid Relief caused. Interestingly, I don't seem to react a bit to the Sensodyne Pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste. I plan on comparing the ingredient list but for now I think my best bet is to take a nap to try to forget the pain. It is really that awful. **Disclaimer** I do have terribly sensitive skin and react to a LOT of things that most people don't. For example, I react to all metals aside from rhodium and platinum.

If you have constant mouth-sores, sensitive gums, bleeding gums and always a weird taste on your tongue and you are using this particular sensodyne, look no further, you are not sick with some horrendous disease, its this toothpaste. Apparently, (dont quote me on it, im not a doctor) Some toothpastes contain an ingredient called Sls which is very strong and can cause these outbreaks. Since i started using this toothpaste, i had constant mouthsores and bleeding gums out of the blue, of course i checked myself out, did everything, stopped coffee, nothing happened then i just randomly started thinking of causes, and googled if toothpaste can cause mouth sores and lo and behold i found this information. I switched toothpastes, went to an organic natural Sls free toothpaste and BINGO! No sores, no bleeding sore gums, fresh feeling, I feel amazing again after months of constant mouthsores. It may work for some and maybe some do not get this side effect but this is my story. The other brands like Sensodyne pro enamal are sls free and do not cause this.

Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won't react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth's surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid's compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defences against teeth sensitivity as it seals exposed dentin. Novamin can also help whiten teeth over time.For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe, however with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is like all the others. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definitely not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste like the EU version has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) may cause stains to form.

Novamin is one of the biggest breakthroughs in dental health since the introduction of fluoride. This ingredient contains the molecules found naturally in human saliva which combine to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, but combined in a way so that they won't react until exposed to water/saliva during brushing.Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth's surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid's compared to the barrier which would have formed from saliva alone which is more vulnerable to acids from the foods we eat and the byproducts of bacteria.The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one, that way this reparative process can start to take place immediately, and even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defences against teeth sensitivity as it seals exposed dentin. Novamin can also help whiten teeth over time.For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe, however with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is like all the others. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definitely not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste like the EU version has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) may cause stains to form.

However, it depends on which sensodyne you use. If you have constant mouth-sores, sensitive gums, bleeding gums and always a weird taste on your tongue and you are using this particular sensodyne, look no further, you are not sick with some horrendous disease, its this toothpaste. Apparently, (dont quote me on it, im not a doctor) Some toothpastes contain an ingredient called Sls which is very strong and can cause these outbreaks. Since i started using this toothpaste, i had constant mouthsores and bleeding gums out of the blue, of course i checked myself out, did everything, stopped coffee, nothing happened then i just randomly started thinking of causes, and googled if toothpaste can cause mouth sores and lo and behold i found this information.

I noticed it's no longer on here though so I thought I'd share again.

Sensodyne sent it for me to try in exchange for my honest opinion. #GotItFree #ButYouCantPayMeToUseItAgainI started using this toothpaste shortly after receiving it and brushed with it twice a day. Right off, I noticed how it seemed to repel water. (Drop a small amount into an already wet sink and watch that water scatter.. cool!) After brushing with it, my mouth felt clean but it almost felt TOO clean. It is hard to explain but it seemed like the toothpaste was drying out my mouth or killing off the bad AND good bacteria -- it seemed as if there was hydrogen peroxide or something in it?? I continued to use the toothpaste and after about the 4th day, I noticed how incredibly dry my lips were. I also was beginning to get a canker sore on the inside of my cheek as well as the corners of my mouth were cracking and hurting. I decided that was enough of the new toothpaste! I have stopped using the Rapid Relief toothpaste and returned to my old Sensodyne Pronamel 2 days ago. Unfortunately, my mouth has not improved and is still getting worse. I literally have not been able to eat much at all except ice cream and nothing helps for the pain. I don't know how long this will take to improve but I already know it won't be fast enough! I've had issues previously with the Sensodyne Pronamel Fresh Breath toothpaste causing canker sores previously; however, never as extreme as this Rapid Relief caused. Interestingly, I don't seem to react a bit to the Sensodyne Pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste. I plan on comparing the ingredient list but for now I think my best bet is to take a nap to try to forget the pain. It is really that awful. **Disclaimer** I do have terribly sensitive skin and react to a LOT of things that most people don't. For example, I react to all metals aside from rhodium and platinum.
